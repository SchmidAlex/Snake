# Snake
   A little snake game in java

# How to play
   To play the game just use the arrows on your keyboard to move the snake. Every 5 points the game will pause and you will go to the next level. Blue is the head of the snake, green the body. The black squares are obstacle and the red are food for the snake.

   Every levelup the game will be faster for 30ms and there will be 1 more obstacle random in the field and 1 more food (except from level 1 to 2).

# Create new levels or a new game
   If you want you can use the hole project and create a new game like pacman in it. Just make a new package in the game-package and copy the things of the package "examplegame" in it. After it i would rename it (see in package snakegame).
